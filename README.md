# The Path Finder

The Path Finder is a web application that visualizes pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to find the shortest path between two points on a grid using A* and Dijkstra's algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Users can draw walls and set start and end points on the grid.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Visualizes the step-by-step process of the A* and Dijkstra's algorithms.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Users can place obstacles to see how the algorithms navigate around them.


## Pathfinding Algorithms

### A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is a popular and efficient pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, often used in many applications like video games and mapping software. It is known for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node by using a heuristic to guide its search.

#### Advantages
- Efficient and optimal for many cases.
- Can be customized with different heuristics for various applications.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It is widely used in network routing and geographical mapping.

#### Advantages
- Guarantees the shortest path in graphs with non-negative weights.
- Simple and effective for various applications.
